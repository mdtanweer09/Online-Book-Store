# üìö Online Book Store

This is a simple web-based **Online Book Store** web application built using **Java (Servlets & JSP)**, **MySQL**, and **HTML/CSS**. 

>  **Purpose**: This project was created to test and demonstrate what I‚Äôve learned so far in Java web development, including:
> - Backend with Java Servlets and JSP.
> - Frontend with HTML, and basic of CSS.
> - Connecting to and interacting with a MySQL database.
> - Implementing CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in a real-world use case.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Java (Servlets & JSP)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Server**: Apache Tomcat

## üß∞ Database Setup

1. Create a MySQL database (e.g., `bookstore`).
2. Run the following SQL to create the `books` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE books (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    author VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL
);
```

## üß† What I Learned

Working on this Online Book Store project helped me strengthen my understanding of:

- Setting up and using **Servlets** and **JSP** for web applications
- Performing **CRUD operations** with **MySQL**
- Connecting frontend and backend logic effectively

 This project was not just a technical task but also an exercise in building something from scratch and applying all the concepts I‚Äôve studied so far.
